# My Advent of code solutions

From [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com)

In the best language of all: [dlang](https://dlang.org).

Organized by year, then by day.

Almost all programs accept input via a filename, some accept the input via parameters or no parameters. I used to store the puzzle inputs as files, but found that was [against the rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs), and so now I only commit the code.

Don't look at the answers if you don't want to know how to do it.

If I am missing days, it's because I didn't get to them.
