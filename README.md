# My Advent of code solutions

From [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com)

In the best language of all: [dlang](https://dlang.org).

Organized by year, then by day.

My puzzle inputs are saved if they are files. Otherwise, the values must come in as parameters. Note that these won't be the same as your parameters, it's different for everyone.

Don't look at the answers if you don't want to know how to do it.

If I am missing days, it's because I didn't get to them.
